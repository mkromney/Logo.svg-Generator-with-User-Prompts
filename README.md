Notes from Jaytee: 
For testing your SVG output:
You would create a file and write tests to see if your code is properly outputting svg code to create a shape
You could just use a single shape for your tests, so you'd only need to import one shape (e.g. const { Square } = require("./shapes");)
For testing your shape classes:
You would create another file for testing your shapes and import all your shape classes
If the code for shapes is in a folder, you would need to make sure to include that in the file path (e.g. ./Lib/shapes.js)
